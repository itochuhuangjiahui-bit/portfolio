## Case Studies

### 1. Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
**Goal:**  
Understand behavioural differences between annual members and casual riders to inform targeted marketing strategies.

**Process:**  
- Data cleaning and preparation: handled missing values and outliers  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): analysed ride frequency, ride length, and day-of-week patterns by rider type  
- Data visualization: used R (ggplot2) to create line charts and bar charts for ride counts and average ride duration  
- Business insights & recommendations: translated findings into actionable strategies

**Key Findings:**  
- Casual riders take **longer rides on weekends** (average ~5,000 seconds) compared to weekdays (~4,000 seconds)  
- Members ride more frequently on **weekdays** (average ride count per day 110k–125k vs 59k–60k on weekends)  
- Casual riders peak on **Sundays**, highlighting opportunities for weekend-focused engagement

**Recommendations:**  
1. Introduce **weekend membership trials** targeting casual riders to increase conversion  
2. Offer **short-term or flexible subscriptions** for weekend riders, lowering psychological barriers to commitment  
3. Reinforce membership value for weekday commuters and leverage seasonal trends for personalized campaigns
